## 🐣 Slingshot Chaos – Because Why Not?

Ever wondered what would happen if you gave a slingshot to a floating ball with rage issues?
Well, I did. And this happened. 💥

### 🎮 What is this?

Just a tiny little 2D prototype I built in Unity — inspired by our OG stressbuster: *Angry Birds*.
You drag, you aim, you launch… and hope the blocks cry in physics pain. 😌

### 💡 Why tho?

Because I was *"just testing stuff"* and accidentally ended up launching a block into orbit. 🚀
That’s when I knew… it deserved a GitHub repo.

### 🧪 Features (a.k.a. Things That Actually Work)

* A slingshot. It slings. Hopefully.
* A projectile. It flies like it’s got a job to do.
* Blocks. They fall and pretend to be smart.
* Reset button. For when things go... *not as planned*.
* Touch controls. Because fingers > mouse.

### 📱 Built With:

* Unity (obviously)
* C# (because it came free with Unity 😜)
* Love, chaos, and trial-by-fire debugging

### ⚠️ Work in progress

Maybe I’ll add explosions.
Maybe I’ll forget I ever made this.
Time will tell.

### 🧠 Real Takeaway:

This was a fun way to understand:

* Rigidbody2D physics
* Touch inputs
* Slingshot mechanics
* How not to break your scene by firing projectiles at light speed

### ✨ Bonus:

If you came here looking for serious architecture or super clean code... bhool jao.
This was powered by gut feeling, coffee, and vibes.

Enjoy thoda tod-phod! 🎶
